# 1. To study and verify the Kirchhoff's law.

## (a) To verify kirchhoff's voltage law.
### Aim:-
The aim of this experiment is to apply Kirchhoff’s rules for electrical circuits to determine the voltage in their respective branches.

### Objectives:-
Analyze closed loops in a circuit to apply KVL, ensuring the sum of voltages is zero.
To measure voltage in a circuit for each element.
To verify Kirchoff's Voltage Law by comparing theoretically calculated values with the practical one.
To understand the application of Kirchhoff’s law.

### Steps to perform Kirchhoff's Voltage Law:-
STEP 1 : Make connections by dragging nodes from apparatus to the circuit.

   (a) Connect power supply to the circuit (1-9, 2-10).
   
   (b) Connect voltmeter (3-11, 4-12) and (5-13, 6-14) and (7-15, 8-16) or you can connect any voltmeter to any resistance in circuit.
   
   (c) Click on the label to delete all the connections for the corresponding nodes.
   
STEP 2 : Check your connections by clicking on the ‘CHECK’ button.

STEP 3 : Set the values of resistances R1, R2 & R3 by adjusting the sliders on left, these values will remain constant throughout the experiment.

STEP 4 : Click the ‘Power’ button to turn on the power supply.

STEP 5 : Now, vary the voltage value by moving the voltage slider to the right side, the readings on the voltmeter will change accordingly.

STEP 6 : Click on the ‘ADD’ button to add the readings to the observation table.

STEP 7 : Repeat steps 6 and 7 until we reach to the 6th reading (Minimum reading to be taken to plot the graph is 6).

STEP 8 : Click on the ‘PLOT’ button to display the graph.

STEP 9 : Click on ‘PRINT’ button to take out the print of the page.

STEP 10 : Click on ‘RESET’ button to refresh the page.

## (b) To verify kirchhoff's Current law.
### Aim:-
The aim of this experiment is to apply Kirchhoff’s rules for electrical circuits to determine the current in their respective branches.

### Objectives:-
Apply KCL to ensure the total current entering a junction equals the total current leaving it.
To measure current in a circuit for each element.
To verify Kirchoff's Current Law by comparing theoretically calculated values with the practical one.
To understand the application of Kirchhoff’s law.

### Steps to perform Kirchhoff's Current Law:-
STEP 1 : Make connections by dragging nodes from apparatus to the circuit.

    (a) Connect power supply to the circuit (1-9, 2-10).

    (b) Connect ammeters (3-11, 4-12) and (5-13, 6-14) and (7-15, 8-16) or you can connect any ammeter to any resistance in circuit.
    
    (c) Click on the label to delete all the connections for the corresponding nodes.
    
STEP 2 : Check your connections by clicking on the ‘CHECK’ button.

STEP 3 : Set the values of resistances R1, R2 & R3 by adjusting the sliders on left, these values will remain constant throughout the experiment.

STEP 4 : Click the ‘Power’ button to turn on the power supply.

STEP 5 : Now, vary the voltage value by moving the voltage slider to the right side, the readings on the ammeter will change accordingly.

STEP 6 : Click on the ‘ADD’ button to add the readings to the observation table.

STEP 7 : Repeat steps 6 and 7 until we reach to the 6th reading (Minimum reading to be taken to plot the graph is 6).

STEP 8 : Click on the ‘PLOT’ button to display the graph.

STEP 9 : Click on ‘PRINT’ button to take out the print of the page.

STEP 10: Click on ‘RESET’ button to refresh the page.
